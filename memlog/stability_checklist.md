# Stability Checklist

## Current Status

### Exception Handling

- [x] Replace broad Exception catches with specific exceptions
- [ ] Add proper error handling for async code
- [x] Remove bare except clauses
- [x] Implement proper error logging
- [x] Add error recovery mechanisms

### Logging System

- [ ] Standardize logging levels across all modules
- [x] Implement consistent log message format
- [x] Add appropriate context to log messages
- [ ] Configure proper log filtering
- [ ] Add performance logging

### Code Quality

- [x] Add type annotations to core functions
- [ ] Add remaining type annotations
- [x] Add comprehensive docstrings to core modules
- [ ] Add remaining docstrings
- [ ] Optimize data structures
- [ ] Externalize configuration values
- [x] Remove unused imports and variables

### Known Issues

#### High Priority

1. Async code error handling needs improvement
2. Inconsistent logging levels make debugging difficult

#### Medium Priority

1. Some type annotations still missing
2. Hardcoded configuration values limit flexibility
3. Some data structures could be optimized for better performance
4. Remaining docstrings need to be added

### Workarounds

No temporary workarounds implemented yet. All issues will be addressed properly through the planned improvements.

## Testing Coverage

- [ ] Exception handling tests
- [ ] Logging system tests
- [ ] Configuration management tests
- [ ] Performance tests
- [ ] Security tests

## Performance Metrics

To be added after implementing performance logging.
