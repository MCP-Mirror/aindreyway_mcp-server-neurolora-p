## Completed Tasks

- [x] ~~Issue 1: Exception Handling~~ (Completed in fix/exception-handling)

### Exception Handling Improvement

**Type**: ðŸš¨ WARNING | ðŸŽ¯ PRIORITY: Medium | âš¡ EFFORT: Small

**Problem**:

- Broad `except Exception` blocks made debugging harder
- Obscured specific error types
- Masked real issues

**Implemented Changes**:

1. Replaced generic exception handlers with specific ones:

```python
# Before
try:
    # code
except Exception:
    # handle error

# After
try:
    # code
except FileNotFoundError:
    # handle specific error
except PermissionError:
    # handle specific error
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Unexpected error: {str(e)}")
    logger.debug("Stack trace:", exc_info=True)
```

2. Implemented proper logging for each exception type
3. Added actionable error messages

**Files Updated**:

- src/mcp_server_neurolorap/collector.py
- src/mcp_server_neurolorap/storage.py
- src/mcp_server_neurolorap/server.py

**Completion Date**: [Current Date]
**Branch**: fix/exception-handling
