## Completed Tasks

### File System Synchronization Improvement

**Type**: ðŸ”§ IMPROVE | ðŸŽ¯ PRIORITY: High | âš¡ EFFORT: Medium

**Problem**:

- Files created by the server were not immediately visible in VSCode Explorer
- Delay in file system updates
- VSCode file watcher was slow to detect new files
- Inconsistent file visibility across different OS environments

**Implemented Changes**:

1. Added forced file synchronization:

```python
# Force flush and sync
output_file.flush()
os.fsync(output_file.fileno())
```

2. Added global file system synchronization:

```python
# Force sync to ensure file is visible
os.sync()
```

3. Added modification time updates for the entire directory chain:

```python
# Touch files and all parent directories
try:
    # Touch output files
    os.utime(code_output_path, None)
    os.utime(analyze_output_path, None)

    # Touch all parent directories up to project root
    current = code_output_path.parent
    while current != self.project_root and current != current.parent:
        os.utime(current, None)
        current = current.parent
    os.utime(self.project_root, None)
except Exception:
    pass  # Ignore if touch fails
```

4. Added small delays after synchronization to ensure file system updates
5. Improved error handling for file system operations
6. Added debug logging for file system operations

**Benefits**:

- Faster file visibility in VSCode Explorer
- More reliable file system synchronization
- Better cross-platform compatibility
- Improved debugging capabilities

**Files Updated**:

- src/mcp_server_neurolorap/collector.py
- src/mcp_server_neurolorap/storage.py

**Completion Date**: 2024-12-24
**Branch**: fix/file-system-sync

- [x] ~~Issue 1: Exception Handling~~ (Completed in fix/exception-handling)
- [x] ~~Issue 2: Performance Optimization~~ (Completed in fix/performance-optimization)
- [x] ~~Issue 3: Logging Level Optimization~~ (Completed in fix/logging-levels)
- [x] ~~Issue 4: Request ID Management~~ (Completed in fix/request-id-management)
- [x] ~~Issue 5: Logging Level Correction~~ (Completed in fix/logging-level-correction)

### Exception Handling Improvement

**Type**: ðŸš¨ WARNING | ðŸŽ¯ PRIORITY: Medium | âš¡ EFFORT: Small

**Problem**:

- Broad `except Exception` blocks made debugging harder
- Obscured specific error types
- Masked real issues

**Implemented Changes**:

1. Replaced generic exception handlers with specific ones:

```python
# Before
try:
    # code
except Exception:
    # handle error

# After
try:
    # code
except FileNotFoundError:
    # handle specific error
except PermissionError:
    # handle specific error
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Unexpected error: {str(e)}")
    logger.debug("Stack trace:", exc_info=True)
```

2. Implemented proper logging for each exception type
3. Added actionable error messages

**Files Updated**:

- src/mcp_server_neurolorap/collector.py
- src/mcp_server_neurolorap/storage.py
- src/mcp_server_neurolorap/server.py

**Completion Date**: [Current Date]
**Branch**: fix/exception-handling

### Performance Optimization

**Type**: ðŸ”§ IMPROVE | ðŸŽ¯ PRIORITY: High | âš¡ EFFORT: Medium

**Problem**:

- Excessive use of `os.sync()` and `time.sleep()`
- Unnecessary filesystem synchronization
- Performance degradation

**Implemented Changes**:

1. Removed redundant sync calls:

```python
# Before
os.sync()
time.sleep(1)
if os.path.exists(path):
    # code

# After
os.makedirs(path, exist_ok=True)
# Continue with operations
```

2. Updated directory operations to use native Python functionality
3. Removed unnecessary file system synchronization

**Files Updated**:

- src/mcp_server_neurolorap/storage.py
- src/mcp_server_neurolorap/collector.py

**Completion Date**: [Current Date]
**Branch**: fix/performance-optimization

### Logging Level Optimization

**Type**: ðŸ”§ IMPROVE | ðŸŽ¯ PRIORITY: Medium | âš¡ EFFORT: Small

**Problem**:

- Excessive INFO level logging
- Log clutter in should_ignore_file
- Performance impact during large scans

**Implemented Changes**:

1. Adjusted logging levels:

```python
# Before
logger.info(f"Walking directory: {path}")

# After
logger.debug(f"Walking directory: {path}")
```

2. Defined clear logging hierarchy:

   - ERROR: Only for actual errors that need immediate attention
   - WARNING: For concerning but non-critical issues
   - INFO: For significant events (start/end of operations)
   - DEBUG: For detailed operational data

3. Updated logging statements across all files to follow the hierarchy

**Files Updated**:

- src/mcp_server_neurolorap/collector.py
- src/mcp_server_neurolorap/storage.py
- src/mcp_server_neurolorap/server.py

**Completion Date**: [Current Date]
**Branch**: fix/logging-levels

### Request ID Management

**Type**: ðŸš¨ WARNING | ðŸŽ¯ PRIORITY: Low | âš¡ EFFORT: Small

**Problem**:

- Unsynchronized request_id counter in JsonRpcTerminal
- Potential race conditions in concurrent scenarios

**Implemented Changes**:

1. Implemented thread-safe counter:

```python
# Before
self.request_id += 1

# After
from itertools import count
self._counter = count()
request_id = next(self._counter)
```

2. Added thread safety documentation:

   - Uses itertools.count() for atomic request ID generation
   - Safe for concurrent command execution
   - Note: Command handlers themselves may not be thread-safe

3. Documented concurrency limitations:
   - Command execution is not parallelized
   - File operations in commands may block
   - Future versions may add async command execution

**Files Updated**:

- src/mcp_server_neurolorap/terminal.py

**Completion Date**: [Current Date]
**Branch**: fix/request-id-management

### Logging Level Correction

**Type**: ðŸš¨ WARNING | ðŸŽ¯ PRIORITY: Medium | âš¡ EFFORT: Small

**Problem**:

- Incorrect use of ERROR level for routine operations
- Misleading severity levels in logs

**Implemented Changes**:

1. Updated logging levels:

```python
# Before
logger.error(f"File system error collecting code: {str(e)}")

# After
logger.warning(f"File system error collecting code: {str(e)}")
```

2. Corrected logging hierarchy:

   - ERROR: Only for unexpected errors that need immediate attention
   - WARNING: For expected errors (FileNotFound, Permission, etc.)
   - INFO: For significant events (start/end of operations)
   - DEBUG: For detailed operational data

3. Improved error message formatting for better readability

**Files Updated**:

- src/mcp_server_neurolorap/server.py

**Completion Date**: [Current Date]
**Branch**: fix/logging-level-correction
